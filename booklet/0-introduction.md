# Practical Computer Science

This workshop helps new developers get acquainted with the best parts of computer science.

I intentionally used the phrase "get acquainted with" in the same manner as we "get acquianted" with someone new for the first time.
You can't get to know everything there is to know about a person over a single cup of coffee.
But it's enough time to _get acquainted_. To think, "I think I could get along with this person. I'd
be willing to meet again sometime."
And it's also enough time to plan your getaway. To think to yourself, "omg how do I end this boring conversation," excuse yourself to the washroom, and discreetly escape out the back door.

By the end of this workshop, you won't be an expert in every topic in computer science.  But you will be _acquainted_ with
the best parts.  You'll have been immersed just enough in the deep parts of the pool to know whether or not you want to go for
another swim.

We will start with the best part of computer science (no sense saving the best for last). We start with Chapter 1: _How to Think_. Whether or not you decide to become a serious computer scientist, web designer, or perhaps a sculptor, musician, or politician, there is no better takeaway from the field of computer science than the skill of computational thinking.
