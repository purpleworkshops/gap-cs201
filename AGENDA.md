# Agenda

## 1pm - 2pm 
1. Von Neumann Architecture
  - Processor -> Processes -> Threads
  - Memory 
  - Call Stacks or Stack Frames
  - Variable Scope

2. What is data?
  - Data that’s "connected together" but suitable for different uses -> "structures"
  - Top 3 Things We Always Do with Data Structures
    - Read some data
    - Insert some new data
    - Sort the data

## 1pm - 2pm 

3. Classic Data Structures and Algorithms
  - Linked List structure: good for simple things, easy to read, write; tough to sort
  - Binary Tree: good for large data set, easy to read, write, easy to sort
  - Graphs: good for networks, flow simulation, harder to read/write, sort

4. Big O notation

## 3pm - 4pm

5. Concepts Worth Knowing:
  - Concurrency vs Parallism
    - Concurrency = one chef multitasking; good when order matters
    - Parallelism = multiple chefs; good when order doesn’t matter
  - Queueing
  - Exception Handling
  - Shell/Terminal commands and the "Unix philosophy"
  - Unit Testing/Test Driven Development
  - Algorithms To Know: 
    - BubbleSort, Quicksort, 
    - Djikstra (shortest path), Traveling Saleseman, Breadth-First, Depth-First, 
    - Huffman Compression, Flood Fill

6. The Best Parts of Computer Science

## 4pm - 5pm

Open office hours / Q&A
